## Project Description

The DELI-cious command line interface allows for a user to manually enter orders to save to a receipt txt file.
The items that can be tracked by the receipt include:

### Sandwiches with:
- Bread
- Toppings
- Premium Toppings 
- Sauces
- Price
### Drinks
- Flavor
- Price

### Chips
- Flavor
- Price

After the user builds their sandwich and buys their side items within the modular interface, the receipt file tracks the price of each available item.
The receipt file is written to the receipts/ directory with a "yyyyMMdd-HHmmss" pattern.


## User Stories

> - As a user, I want to have an option to exit the application so that I can leave without placing an order if I change my mind.
> - As a user, I want to be able to pick between items like sandwich, drink, and chips so that I can customize my order with the available options.
> - As a user, I want to be able to customize my sandwich by selecting bread type, adding meat, cheese, and other toppings, and choosing sauces so that I can create a sandwich to my taste.
> - As a user, I want to be able to pick a drink so that I can include a beverage with my meal.
> - As a user, I want to be able to see the items Iâ€™ve picked and confirm them so that I can review my order before finalizing.
